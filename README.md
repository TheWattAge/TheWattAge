# Hello and welcome...

**My name's Craig**, and I've been learning web and software development for the past four years, 
though I've found myself mostly completing exercises and projects on learning platforms like CodeCademy, 
Hyperskill, Khan Academy, LinkedIn Learning and following YouTube tutorials.

I'm now looking to apply and improve my skills to live projects and to share my code with portential collaborators,
mentors or employers.

I am knowledgeable of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MySQL and PHP, having built my own custom a Content Management System 
utilising these technologies.

Over the past year my focus has shifted toward software development, having almost completed the Hyperskill curriculum
in Java, algorithms and completed a couple of projects along the way.

I'm currently using the revamped Codecademy platform, to allow me to focus on a structured path toward building my
portfolio as a web developer, and I will be posting these projects to the platform.

I've also tinkered with some VBA in Excel building macros to automate processes, as well as basic programs in C and C#.

There are just too many languages out there sometimes and there's no time to master them all, but my general approach
is to learn enough to get started and to understand a technology, without necessarily specialising in the minute details
of a language, until I figure out the best way to realise my own projects.

My other interests are in filmmaking, photography, design, animation, music and videogames.

I am currently studying for my Higher Diploma in Science - Computing (Software Development) at GMIT, and will Graduate Dec 2022.
